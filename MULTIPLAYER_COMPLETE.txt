                            QUICK START (2 MIN)
================================================================================

TEST LOCALLY:
  Terminal 1: godot
              Click "Host Game" button

                           HOW IT ALL WORKS
================================================================================

HOSTING:
  1. Player clicks "Host Game"
  2. Server starts listening on port 9999
  3. Your player spawns at spawn point
  4. Game waits for clients to connect

JOINING:
  1. Player clicks "Join Game"
  2. Enters server IP (or localhost for testing)
  3. Connects to server
  4. Server spawns your player
  5. You receive sync updates from other players

REAL-TIME SYNC:
  - Your player: You control locally, syncs every 0.1 seconds
  - Others: Receives RPC updates, smoothly interpolates
  - Input: Only processes if you own the character
  - Movement: Instant for you, smooth for others

AUTHORITY SYSTEM:
  - Each player has authority over themselves
  - You can only control your own character
  - Others see your movement via network sync
  - Only you see instant movement (cheating prevention)

================================================================================
                           CUSTOMIZATION
================================================================================

CHANGE PORT (default: 9999):
  Edit: multiplayer_manager.gd
  Line: const PORT: int = 9999

CHANGE MAX PLAYERS (default: 4):
  Edit: multiplayer_manager.gd
  Line: const MAX_PLAYERS: int = 4

CHANGE SYNC RATE (default: 10 Hz):
  Edit: multiplayer_controller.gd
  Line: @export var sync_rate: float = 0.1
  (Lower = more responsive but more bandwidth)

ADD SPAWN POINTS:
  Edit: multiplayer_manager.gd
  In: spawn_player() method
  Modify: spawn_points array

================================================================================
                        NETWORK PERFORMANCE
================================================================================

BANDWIDTH: ~400 bytes/sec per connected player
  Example 4 players: ~1.2 KB/sec (very efficient!)

LATENCY TOLERANCE:
  < 50ms:    Excellent (feels instant)
  50-100ms:  Good (smooth)
  100-200ms: Acceptable (noticeable delay)
  200-500ms: Sluggish (playable)
  > 500ms:   Very jerky (hard to play)

SYNC UPDATES:
  Rate: 10 Hz (every 0.1 seconds) by default
  Type: Position + Rotation
  Method: Unreliable RPC (fast, may drop 1-2%)
  Interpolation: Smooth client-side lerp

================================================================================

STEP 1 - Quick Overview (5 min):
  Read: README_MULTIPLAYER.md

STEP 2 - Get It Working (10 min):
  Read: MULTIPLAYER_QUICK_START.md

STEP 3 - Understand It (20 min):
  Read: ARCHITECTURE.md

STEP 4 - Use & Extend (15 min):

  (Adding health, chat, security, optimization)

TOTAL TIME: 60-90 minutes to fully understand

================================================================================
                          COMMON ISSUES
================================================================================

"Connection failed!"
  → Check firewall allows port 9999
  → Verify server IP is correct
  → Make sure server started first

Other players not appearing
  → Check "Players: X" display
  → Look at console for error messages
  → Try on same machine first (localhost)

Stuttery movement
  → Check network latency (should be < 200ms)
  → Lower sync_rate value for more updates
  → Ensure network connection is stable

Only my player visible
  → Verify peer connection succeeded
  → Check spawn points are valid
  → Look for script errors in console

================================================================================
                         NEXT STEPS (OPTIONAL)
================================================================================

JUST WANT TO PLAY?
  → Run godot twice, one hosts, one joins
  → Both players should appear and move together
  → Try moving around for 5 minutes
  → Congratulations, multiplayer works!

WANT TO UNDERSTAND?
  → Read README_MULTIPLAYER.md (quick overview)
  → Read ARCHITECTURE.md (system design)
  → You'll understand exactly how it all works

WANT TO ADD FEATURES?
  → Read ADVANCED.md for code examples
  → Health system (add damage, death)
  → Chat system (player communication)
  → Player names (show above characters)
  → Weapons/combat interactions
  → Item pickup/inventory

WANT TO OPTIMIZE?
  → Read ADVANCED.md performance tuning section
  → Adjust sync_rate based on bandwidth
  → Only sync when position changes significantly
  → Monitor bandwidth usage
  → Test with real network latency

================================================================================
                            KEY CONCEPTS
================================================================================

PEER ID:
  - Server: peer ID 1
  - First client: peer ID 2
  - Second client: peer ID 3
  - etc.

PLAYER NAMING:
  - Players named "Player_<peer_id>"
  - Example: "Player_1", "Player_2"

AUTHORITY:
  - Each player has authority (ownership) over themselves
  - Example: Only peer 2 can control Player_2
  - If not authority: Input disabled, gets RPC updates

RPC METHODS:
  - spawn_player() - Create new player (reliable)
  - sync_transform() - Update position/rotation (unreliable, fast)

MULTIPLAYER GROUP:
  - All players added to "players" group
  - Use get_tree().get_nodes_in_group("players") to find all players

================================================================================
                         TESTING CHECKLIST
================================================================================

BASIC FUNCTIONALITY:
  ☐ Can host a game
  ☐ Can join a game (localhost)
  ☐ Both instances show "Players: 2"
  ☐ Your character moves with WASD
  ☐ Other player appears and moves
  ☐ Disconnect button works
  ☐ Can reconnect after disconnect

NETWORK TESTING:
  ☐ Test on same machine (localhost) - should work perfectly
  ☐ Test on local network - should work if firewall allows
  ☐ Check bandwidth usage (should be < 1 KB/sec for 2 players)
  ☐ Check latency (ping player machine)

EDGE CASES:
  ☐ Host disconnects - client returns to menu
  ☐ Client disconnects - host continues
  ☐ Server full (4 players) - 5th player can't join
  ☐ Invalid IP - shows error, allows retry

================================================================================
